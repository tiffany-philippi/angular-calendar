# angular-calendar

## The Task

The goal of this project is to create a demo calendar application using Angular. This application doesn't use any calendar library.


### Instructions

Make sure you have installed all Angular dependecies before start to create your reminders. 

It'll have a better performance if you use Firefox, but it works using Google Chrome as well.

After clone this repository, open the terminal and type `ng serve` or `ng serve -o` if you prefer the command opens your browser automatically.


### Features:

* Ability to add a new “reminder” for a user entered day and time.
* Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
* Allow the user to select a color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
* Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
* Ability to edit reminders – including changing text, day and time & color.
* Ability to delete reminders.
* Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.


### Notes:
1. I deployed the project in Vercel server. The link is below.

2. Some features that I'd like to do to improve my application: 
    * Create a Day and Week view
    * Include reminders with more than 1 day of duration
    * To specify end time to have a better user experience when set Day/Week View
    * Show on top the closest reminder
    * Add test routine
